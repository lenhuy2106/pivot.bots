learning.example=A front-end developer is a programmer that codes the front end of a website. Typically, the front-end developer's job is to convert website design files into raw HTML, JavaScript (JS) and/or CSS code. This includes the basic website design/layout, images, content, buttons, navigation and internal links. The end result is code that serves as the website's front-end structure, which is used by a back-end developer to add business logics and connect databases and processes, among other processes. A front-end developer is responsible for ensuring that a website's visual front end is free of errors and looks exactly as designed. A front-end developer also ensures that a website has the same visibility across different computing and mobile Web browsers. Similarly, in software applications, a front-end web developer creates the graphical user interface (GUI) that enables access to the software's back-end features and capabilities.
